            <!-- BIO Text -->
                <p>Upon graduation from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute with a degree in 
                    mechanical engineering, I began working for a large aerospace company as a project 
                    engineer, working on the Chandra space satellite.  I continued to develop my project management
                    skills working for a small firm in the petroleum industry as their construction project 
                    liaison to major oil companies.</p>
                <p>And then I became a mother...and I left that world behind me.</p>
                <p>Not long after, I started a web design firm.  Together with a network of web professionals, 
                    I worked with small companies to establish their online presence.  I ran this firm for a 
                    decade, overseeing the projects and piecing the design and the backend pieces together with HTML and CSS. </p>
                <p>And then we moved to Texas...and I became certified to teach math.</p>
                <p>For the next 9 years, I taught high school geometry.  As a teacher I honed my 
                    organizational skills, practiced prioritizing and developed an even great amount of 
                    patience.  But it was never the same sense of satisfaction or accomplishment, and I longed 
                    to be back on the web.</p>
                <p>And then somehow things aligned, opportunites appeared...
                    and I left teaching to go to coding bootcamp.</p>
                <p>And here I am.  I love life, I love coding.</p>
